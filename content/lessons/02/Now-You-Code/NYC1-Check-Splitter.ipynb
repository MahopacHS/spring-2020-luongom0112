It first prompts you to input the total amount of your check, then the number of people dining. It should then output the amout each diner must contribute to the check.  For example:\n\n```\n*** Check Splitter ***\nHow much is the amount of the check? 100.00\nHow many people ? 6\nEach person owes: $16.67\n```\n\nNOTE: Use string formatters to display the output to two decimal places.\n"

What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nAnswer:   Then the program will show an error because you cannot find the float or integer of letters or symbols, only numbers.\n\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nAnswer:   This is a exception error. I think it can be handled in code, possibly by requesting for a number or adding a $ at the end of the string so that the person does not write the $.\n\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nAnswer:   \n\nYes, the program runs but it makese no sense. The cost would be double the amount of the check.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nThe original problem analysis did not work as assigned, it took me two iterations to go through before I arrived at the solution. It was a simple mess up of mistyping a simple code.Next time, I should take it slow and make sure not to make any errors so that I remember the steps and avoid any simple mistakes. I realized that the code needs to be accurate and precise to make the program work correctly and in the way you want it to run. I learned to  remember to put everyhing as a float or an integer, or else it is impossible to divide it. Also, remembering to put the %() inside the parenthesis for print is very important, or else you will get a syntax error.\n\n\n"
