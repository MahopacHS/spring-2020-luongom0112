Record any questions you have about this lab that you would like to ask in recitation. It is expected you will have questions if you did not complete the code sections correctly.  Learning how to articulate what you do not understand is an important skill of critical thinking. \n\nAnswer: Questions about this lab I have is how to round integer values up instead of down. -Update- just found out that if I use float values to 0 decimal places, it rounds up. Other than that, I understood everyhting in the lab.\n\n2. What was the most difficult aspect of completing this lab? Least difficult?  \n\nAnswer: The most difficult aspect of completing this lab was remebering that you cannot convert from a string with decimal to an integer. You have to put it in float first. The least difficult was printing the text with the %f, %d, %s.\n\n3. What aspects of this lab do you find most valuable? Least valuable?\n\nAnswer: I found it most valuable to be able to convert to float values from string so that I could use it for multiplication & addition.. etc. I found it least variable to use integer values because float values can just be rounded so that they're displayed to 0 decimal places.\n\n4. Rate your comfort level with this week's material so far.   \n\n1 ==> I can do this on my own and explain how to do it.   \n2 ==> I can do this on my own without any help.   \n3 ==> I can do this with help or guidance from others. If you choose this level please list those who helped you.   \n4 ==> I don't understand this at all yet and need extra help. If you choose this please try to articulate that which you do not understand.   \n\nAnswer: 1\n\n"
