Provide 3 advantages for programming a user function in your code like `CircleArea`  or `CircleCircumference`\n\nAnswer:\n1- does not need to be written multiple times, you can just input it once.\n2- Simpler than writing out many lines of code.\n3- Easier for the computer to handle.\n\n2. If we want to guarantee our `CircleCircumference` function is 100% accurate, what is the minimum number of test cases must we provide in step 3?\n\nAnswer: At least 2 test cases. The first one, if you plug in 1 for radius, you don't know if it even has an effect, so plug in another number just to verify it.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nI thought this was fairly easy. After a few minutes of trial and error, I was able to successfully complete the program. It took me ony a couple of iterations, and didn't take too much time. I feel I am starting to grasp the information better. I need to work on using these functions more often to get a better grip on how to use them. The use of functions is coming to me much more easily now.\n\n"
