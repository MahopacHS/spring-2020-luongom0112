The program should keep asking you to enter grocery items until you type `'done'`.\n\nAfter you complete the list, the program should then load the file and read the list back to you by printing each item out.\n\nSample Run:\n\n```\nLet's make a shopping list. Type 'done' when you're finished:\nEnter Item: milk\nEnter Item: cheese\nEnter Item: eggs\nEnter Item: beer\nEnter Item: apples\nEnter Item: done\nYour shopping list:\nmilk\ncheese\neggs\nbeer\napples\n```\n"

Explain how this program could be refactored further (there's one thing that's obvious).\n\nAnswer: By breaking it down into more steps\n\n\n3. Describe how this program can be modified to support multiple shopping lists?\n\nAnswer:So that you could chools what file you want to open."

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nIt took me a long time to understand how to do the second question. I still do not know how to do this. It took many iterations adn the original problem analysis did not work as designed. I need to keep working on this, but I do not know exacrtly what to do. I wish we could have some class time!!\n"
